# Video download script
- Go to your livestream with Chrome.
- Open Developer Tools
- Go to Tab Network
- Find one of the media files. They look like media_xxxxxxxxxx_2.ts or so.
- Copy your request URL. Something like: http://cdnxxd.streampartner.nl:1935/newmediasystems_xx_ond/mp4:xxxx.mp4/media_xxxxxxxxxx_2.ts
- Find the last number of your stream by skipping to the last second of the stream. In our example this is _199.ts
- Edit download.sh, edit the found URL and change the number 199 to the desired ending.
- Edit combine.sh, edit the found media_xxxxxxxxxx_2.ts name and the number 199 to the desired ending.
- chmod +x download.sh and combine.sh
- Execute download.sh, wait.
- Execute combine.sh
- You got your video backupped for free as it should be instead of $$$. The result is video.mp4
